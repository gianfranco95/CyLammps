# CyLammps
A python library used to analyze molecular dynamics simulations. 
Simulations are produced by [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html) . 
I used the cython library to improve performances and . 
All the quantity calculated are really important to study the mechanical properties of amorphous materials.
