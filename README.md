# CyLammps
A python library used to analyze molecular dynamics simulations. 
Simulations are produced by [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html) . 
I used the cython library to improve performances. 
All the quantity calculated are really important to study the mechanical properties of amorphous materials.
Among the others there is the [coarse-grained stress](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epje/i2002-10073-5)
and the stress [spatial autocorrelation functions](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.245702).
